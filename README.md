## [Experiment 1 : Solving Tower of Hanoi using Recursion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_hRp5XcbNSkFNvlLtYMVCVwG5CMisZSlIA5xz2MM1kk/edit?usp=sharing)

**Code:** 
* [Exp1_TOH.c](https://github.com/Ash4-k/DSA-LAB/blob/main/Exp1/Exp1_TOH.c)


    ***The challenge is to move a set of disks from a source pole to a destination pole using an auxiliary pole, following these rules:***

    * Only one disk can be moved at a time. 
    * A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
    * The goal is to move all disks to the destination pole.

## [Experiment 2 : Stack Operations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eeobnEWJhxAAfCECxgsNmEAGAU3BdZpgL1_AEe8gRjc/edit?usp=sharing)

**Code:**
* [Exp2_Stack.c](https://github.com/Ash4-k/DSA-LAB/blob/main/Exp2/Exp2_Stack.c)


    ***In this experiment, we perform basic operations on a stack:***

    * **push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    * **pop**: Removes the topmost element from the stack.
    * **peek (top)**: Displays the topmost element without removing it.
    * **isEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
    * **isFull**: Checks if the stack is full.
    * **display**: Shows all elements currently in the stack.

## [Experiment 3 : Implementing Queue Operations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-CTO5Aj0JkhocFczA5S_haIPYggQZ7Spe3kfkI6ikhU/edit?usp=sharing)
**Code:** 
* [Exp3_queue.c](https://github.com/Ash4-k/DSA-LAB/blob/main/Exp3/Exp3_queue.c)

    **Problem Statement :**
    ***Design and develop a program to perform the following operations on a Queue data structure :***

    * **enqueue()** : Adds an element to the end (rear) of the queue.
    * **dequeue()** : Removes an element from the front of the queue.
    * **top()** : Returns the first element in the queue without removing it.
    * **initialize()** : Creates an empty queue.
    * **display()** : Displays all elements currently in the queue.
